# Goal
Develop a web site using react with ts. The main idea of this 20-20-20 web app is that: for well being purpose, users shall rest for at least 20 seconds (looking towards something 20 meters away) every 20 mins of continuous work.

# Main Ideas
- I want this web to be beautiful and minimalist. 
- I want the frontend UI to have a sense of Zen.
- I want the frontend to have fewer buttons. 
- The major button on the page shall be a "start" for the timer.
- I want the user be able to change the time length of the timer (default is 20mins, could be 25 or 37 or so.)
- Once the timer ends, I want the page to show a pause and pop out a notification. The user can then stop whenever they feel like and go out to relax. (i.e. we don't need a relaxing timer for that 20 seconds.)
- After that, the user can come back, exit the pause and restart a new timer.

# Main features
- notification with sound
- a progress bar (in green color!)
- customizable timer

# TODOS
- [ ] deploy
- [ ] add a few default options (in setting window)
- [ ] add "about" button (in setting window)
